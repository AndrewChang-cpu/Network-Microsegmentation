# CC Project 2: Network Microsegmentation

This is a sub-project of the Arculus Project from Mizzou's CERI Lab. This project implements the functionality of editing, creating, and deleting network policies for the communication of pods in clusters.

### Usage

For now, the data is fed through the Node backend. In the future, we are going to connect it with the EC2 instances to actually represent the changes to the real pods

# Backend

```sh
npm run server
```

# Frontend
```sh
npm start
```
